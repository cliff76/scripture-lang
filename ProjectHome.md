Scripture is a novelty programming language that incorporates religious lingo and ideas into its syntax.  This is what the "Hello World" looks like:

```
preach "Hello World";
```

Things get more interesting as you dive into the other constructs of the language or attempt to use it's Latin, Hebrew, or Greek keywords:

```
scriptura mynamespace:

    prophecy genesis:
        artefactum foo = let there be Foo;
        foo.go;
    amen

    order Foo ex nihilo:
        commandment go:
            pray 1;
            preach "Hello from an instance of Foo!";
        amen
    amen

    prophecy genesis:
        preach "There can be multiple prophecies!";
        pray 2;
        preach "And they completely independent.";
    amen

amen
```
